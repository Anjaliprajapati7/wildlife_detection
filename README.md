# Wildlife Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project focuses on the exploration of diverse architectures and algorithms to track suspicious wildlife activities, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing. The image dataset utilized in this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Techniques Used

### Classification with VGG16
The VGG16 architecture is employed for classification tasks. It is a deep CNN architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness. By fine-tuning pre-trained VGG16 models, the system can classify images into different categories, facilitating the identification of wildlife species or activities.

### Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
Segmentation is a crucial step in identifying objects within an image. K-Means clustering is utilized to segment images into distinct clusters, aiding in isolating relevant objects from the background.

### Localization and Detection using Sliding Window
Localization and detection are essential for identifying the precise location and extent of wildlife activities within an image. A sliding window approach is implemented to scan through the image at different scales and positions, enabling the detection of suspicious activities.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images sourced from Kaggle, containing various wildlife scenes and activities. The dataset is annotated with labels indicating the presence of suspicious activities, enabling supervised learning for model training.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to enhance image quality, remove noise, and standardize image dimensions.
2. **Classification**: VGG16 architecture is utilized for classifying segmented objects into different categories.
3. **Segmentation**: K-Means clustering is applied to segment images, separating objects of interest from the background.
4. **Localization and Detection**: A sliding window approach is employed to detect and localize suspicious activities within the image.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the developed models is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNN-based techniques for tracking suspicious wildlife activities using image processing. By employing segmentation, classification, localization, and detection methods, the system can accurately identify and monitor wildlife behavior, contributing to wildlife conservation efforts and combating illegal activities.
